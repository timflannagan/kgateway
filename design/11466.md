# EP-11466: Weighted HTTP Route Precedence


* Issue: [#11466](https://github.com/kgateway-dev/kgateway/issues/11466)


## Background

The ordering of routes determines their priority relative to one another, such that if a route matches a request, no further routes are evaluated. Thus, routes appearing earlier in the order have higher precedence.

Currently, Kgateway sorts HTTPRoute rules based on the Gateway API specification which prioritizes routes by path specificity, number of headers, query parameters, and other criteria, as defined in the [HTTP route precedence rules](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/spec/#httprouterule). However, there are use cases where administrators need explicit control over route precedence regardless of these standard criteria.

## Motivation

Users need the ability to:
1. Override default route precedence when standard Gateway API ordering doesn't meet their requirements
1. Control route ordering in complex scenarios where multiple routes have similar specificity. E.g., with regex based matchers that are implementation specific and do not have a clear specificity level.
1. Aid migration from other gateway implementations that support weighted route precedence.

## Goals

- Enable weighted route precedence through the `kgateway.dev/route-weight` annotation on `HTTPRoutes`
- Preserve standard Gateway API precedence rules when the feature is disabled
- Preserve standard Gateway API precedence rules as a secondary sort criterion within the same weight group
- Make the feature opt-in via the `KGW_WEIGHTED_ROUTE_PRECEDENCE` environment variable

## Non-Goals

- Modifying the Gateway API specification
- Automatic weight assignment based on heuristics
- Supporting weights on non-HTTP route types (TCPRoute, TLSRoute, etc.)

## Implementation Details

### Feature Enablement

This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the `KGW_WEIGHTED_ROUTE_PRECEDENCE` environment variable to `true`, which enables the `WeightedRoutePrecedence` global setting. When enabled, all routes are assigned a default weight of `0` if the annotation is not present.

### Annotation Format

The `kgateway.dev/route-weight` annotation accepts a 32-bit integer value (including negative numbers):

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: high-priority-route
  annotations:
    kgateway.dev/route-weight: "100"
...
```

### Sorting Algorithm

When `KGW_WEIGHTED_ROUTE_PRECEDENCE=true`:

1. **Primary Sort**: Routes are sorted by weight in descending order (higher weights first)
2. **Secondary Sort**: Within each weight group, routes are sorted by standard Gateway API precedence rules

### Example Behavior

When the feature is enabled, the route rules in the [HTTPRoutes with weights](/internal/kgateway/translator/gateway/testutils/inputs/route-sort-weighted.yaml) are sorted by weights and then by standard Gateway API precedence rules within the same weight group to produce [outputs](/internal/kgateway/translator/gateway/testutils/outputs/route-sort-weighted.yaml) that reflect the desired ordering.

### Test Plan

Unit tests and translator tests will be added to ensure correct sorting of routes based on weights and standard precedence rules.

## Alternatives

### 1. Feature enablement using GatewayParameters
- **Pros**: Per Gateway configuration.
- **Cons**: Additional API and implementation complexity.
