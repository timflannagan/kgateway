                                      headers.

                                          Name is the name of the HTTP Header to be matched. Name matching MUST be
                                          case insensitive. (See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2).

                                          If multiple entries specify equivalent header names, only the first
                                          entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                          entries with an equivalent header name MUST be ignored. Due to the
                                          case-insensitivity of header names, "foo" and "Foo" are considered
                                          equivalent.

                                          When a header is repeated in an HTTP request, it is
                                          implementation-specific behavior as to how this is represented.
                                          Generally, proxies should follow the guidance from the RFC:

                                    Name is the name of the HTTP Header to be matched. Name matching MUST be
                                    case insensitive. (See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2).

                                    If multiple entries specify equivalent header names, only the first
                                    entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                    entries with an equivalent header name MUST be ignored. Due to the
                                    case-insensitivity of header names, "foo" and "Foo" are considered
                                    equivalent.

                                    When a header is repeated in an HTTP request, it is
                                    implementation-specific behavior as to how this is represented.
                                    Generally, proxies should follow the guidance from the RFC:
                                    https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230.html#section-3.2.2 regarding

                                      HTTPHeaderMatch describes how to select a HTTP route by matching HTTP request
                                      headers.

                                          Name is the name of the HTTP Header to be matched. Name matching MUST be
                                          case insensitive. (See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2).

                                          If multiple entries specify equivalent header names, only the first
                                          entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                          entries with an equivalent header name MUST be ignored. Due to the
                                          case-insensitivity of header names, "foo" and "Foo" are considered
                                          equivalent.

                                          When a header is repeated in an HTTP request, it is
                                          implementation-specific behavior as to how this is represented.
                                          Generally, proxies should follow the guidance from the RFC:

                            connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                            the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a

                            both specified values.
                            * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                            are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                            both specified values.

                            Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                            If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                            interpreted.

                            When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                            least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                            namespace, or hostname.
