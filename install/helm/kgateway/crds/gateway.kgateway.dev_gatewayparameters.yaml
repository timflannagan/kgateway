                                    preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                    container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                    PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                    container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                    period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                    or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                this init container will be continually restarted on
                                exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                container.

                              "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                              This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                              "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                              This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                              It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                              Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
